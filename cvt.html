        <h1>Construction Video Tutorials</h1>
        <p>
          With the popularization of DIY shows on TV, there has been a steady
          growth of users searching for video tutorials for small projects to do
          around the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenge was to create a responsive website that delivers results
          by giving all the construction content needed in one place.

              An initial Competitive Audit was launched but did not generate a
              lot of information about competitors. There are many video
              streaming websites with just a few related videos, and sites just
              focused on construction in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              I developed a research plan with a few open questions to reveal
              user needs, motives, and pain points. There wasn’t a lot of
              clarity about who the main users would be for this product, except
              for homeowners in my initial draw. I still included 2 people that
              didn’t own a home but are working in the construction industry,
              just to test the value of the concept with a different group.
            </p>
            <p>
              The research confirmed a few assumptions about the pain points,
              but including the two people outside the main target user, proved
              to be an impactful move that opened a new proposition value to
              address not only the research side of remodels but to include a
              new construction section with training value.
            </p>
            <p>
              From that research, I proceeded to create my personas and empathy
              maps to understand the user’s journey, and the following pain
              points and goals became clear.

            <p>
              Based on my research, I created a design with simplicity in mind.
              I made sure not to overwhelm the home screen with too many video
              suggestions so that users could easily achieve their main goal. To
              achieve this, I created three different user journeys: two
              assisted methods by category, one for new construction and another
              one for remodels/DIY, and a simple search for those that wanted to
              search for a specific keyword.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my low-fidelity prototype, I added the three main user journeys
              with a simple layout to avoid overwhelming users with excessive
              information. I also addressed some of the pain points discovered
              during the research, and made the user interaction with the site
              more straightforward. I tested this prototype with eight users,
              and 93% of them completed their tasks on time. However, some
              people commented that there were too many choices when exploring
              new construction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on this feedback, I decided to use the same steps for the
              user journey for new construction and remodel research to simplify
              the learning curve for new users. The information structure
              remained the same, so the information architecture didn't change.
              After finalizing the mockups, I generated the prototype and
              conducted a second usability test. This time around, 95% of users
              completed their tasks, but some suggested adding summaries for the
              videos. This was noted for future releases.

              One thing I learned was that when you include a user profile in
              your research that might not be the focus of the design but that
              in some way is related to your current project can open the scope
              of the project and increase its reach and user value, and at the
              same time increase of profit potential for the business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized that even though it may not seem like a complex big
              product to design, the potential for it to grow, simplify user’s
              experiences, and help make the decisions and assist on normally
              complex and expensive tasks is enormous.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no measurement as to the success of this design in the
              real world, but having validated the simplicity of the user
              journeys and reflected on the benefits of having the one
              repository that’s missing in the real world, I consider this one
              in the success column.
