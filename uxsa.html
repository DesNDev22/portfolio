        <h1>UXSA Volunteer Page</h1>
        <p>
          UXSA is an organization that supports the UX community in San Antonio
          by creating ways for people to connect, explore, and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          They wanted to redesign their Volunteer page to have better engagement
          from the UX community, by offering clear opportunities. They organized
          a Remote Design Sprint, and I participated as a UX Designer.

              We were introduced to the stakeholders, and they were given time
              to explain not only the organization's business and social goals
              but also the expectations and benchmarks to measure the success of
              such redesign along with all the research that had been done to
              that point.
            </p>
            <p>
              As they were presenting all the facts we proceeded to write our
              "How Might We's" sticky notes on Mural and at the end we put them
              to a vote and organized them into themes to start defining the
              most compelling "HMW" opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only the team voted on this but the stakeholders were also
              given the opportunity to vote to have a better alignment with the
              prioritization of the organization's goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the questions I asked the stakeholders for clarification
              was whether or not they were thinking about national outreach and
              opportunities or if it was going to be just a local effort. I
              thought it was important to address this given the nature of the
              current market trends, and from a user point of view.

              We began by sorting HMW (how might we) cards and discussing the
              main goals of stakeholders. During the ideate phase, each team
              member presented and explained their sketches, and we all voted on
              the best features. I then created a mid-fidelity design that
              incorporated the most popular features and sections, while keeping
              the structure of the website in mind. I decided to stick to the
              current website layout and created a main page with a call to
              action for the organization's mission, benefits of volunteering,
              steps to volunteer, and off-ramp options.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design also included a search page with filters by skill and a
              detailed page for each volunteer opportunity. I believed this
              would address all of the main objectives for the design. The final
              prototype for user testing was done by one of the facilitators of
              the Sprint. We worked on the tasks and questions to ask the users
              recruited for the User Test, and groups were assigned to each
              user.
            </p>
            <p>
              We managed to get four users for remote testing of the prototype
              that had been put together. Following the scripted questions and
              tasks, each user was paired with a team of two members of the
              sprint for better note-taking. Some of the most relevant insights
              from the user testing were that the order of information presented
              by relevance, time expectations, and skills filters were
              important, while the featured volunteer opportunities carousel was
              irrelevant.

              This was a very interesting process. We ran into technical
              difficulties and time constraints but I believe we managed to
              accomplish the goals set for it. The sprint lasted 6 weeks, and
              ran on Saturdays 2-3 hours each session.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I were to change something it would probably be the research
              side of it. I don't believe we had all the information that
              could've been relevant for this particular process and maybe use
              A/B Testing since there was another prototype that could've been
              used that might have cover some of the observations from the user
              tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned that teamwork is extremely important for this
              methodology and that constant feedback gives clarity to the
              overall direction of the effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was very satisfying to see some of my ideas to go into the
              final product and the acceptance that users showed in the user
              tests. This was very motivating and encouraging.
